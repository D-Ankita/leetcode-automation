# Set up the WebDriver (you need to download the appropriate driver for your browser)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Step 1: Go to LeetCode
driver.get("https://leetcode.com")

# Step 2: Login (replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual credentials)
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

driver.find_element_by_name("login").send_keys(username)
driver.find_element_by_name("password").send_keys(password)
driver.find_element_by_name("password").send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Wait for the login to complete (you might need to adjust the sleep time)
time.sleep(5)

# Step 3: Go to the problem of the day
driver.get("https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-of-the-day/")

# Step 4: Go to discussions
driver.find_element_by_link_text("Discuss").click()

# Wait for the discussions to load
time.sleep(5)

# Step 5: Find the solution (you need to add the specific logic to locate the solution)

# Step 6: Copy the solution (you need to add the specific logic to copy the solution)

# Step 7: Paste it (you need to add the specific logic to paste the solution)

# Step 8: Submit it (you need to add the specific logic to submit the solution)

# Close the browser
